# bash-aliases
Collection of bash aliases

This repo consists of [bash aliases](.bash_aliases) that I put and keep on using on my systems. I try to keep this list as updated and hope that this can be useful for others too to save some time typing.

### Install

```shell
wget -O ~/.bash_aliases https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techgaun/bash-aliases/master/.bash_aliases
```
